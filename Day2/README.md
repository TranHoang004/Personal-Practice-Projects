## Day 2
### Overview
This directory contains the code and resources for Day 2 of the project. The focus is on implementing advanced features and optimizations based on the foundational work done in Day 1.
### Topics Covered
- Learning python variables and data types
- Understanding control flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and modules
- Learning javascript variables and data types
- Understanding control flow in JavaScript
- Functions and modules in JavaScript
- Introduction to asynchronous programming in JavaScript
This day builds and practices a few more advanced concepts in both Python and JavaScript, enhancing your programming skills and understanding of these languages.
### Learning Objectives
- Understand and use variables and data types in Python and JavaScript
- Implement control flow structures effectively
- Create and use functions and modules in both languages
- Gain a basic understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript
