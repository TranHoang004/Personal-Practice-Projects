# Day 4 - Python Practice

Welcome to Day 4 of the 14-day code challenge! This folder contains Python scripts and exercises focused on building foundational programming skills.

## Contents

- **Lear.py**  
    Solutions to basic algorithmic problems, such as calculating the ratio of positive, negative, and zero values in a list (plus-minus problem). Demonstrates list processing and formatted output.

- **Learning.py**  
    A collection of small Python exercises, including:
      - Checking for leap years
      - Printing number sequences
      - Summing item prices using `OrderedDict` while preserving insertion order
      - Additional input/output and loop examples

- **README.md**  
    This file. Provides an overview and usage instructions.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Day4` folder.
2. Run a script with Python:

     python Lear.py

     or

     python Learning.py

3. Follow the prompts for any required input.

## Topics Covered

- User input and output
- Functions and control flow
- List and dictionary operations
- Using `OrderedDict` for ordered mappings
