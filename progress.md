# Personal Practice Projects - Progress Report

## Day 1: Git & GitHub Basics

- Learned core concepts of Git and GitHub.

- Topics covered:
  - What are Git and GitHub?
  - Creating, cloning, and managing repositories.
  - Making changes, committing, pushing, and pulling.
  - Branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.
  - Pull requests, code reviews, closing and deleting branches.
  - Viewing commit history, using tags, GitHub Issues, Projects, Actions, and Pages.

- Practice:
  - Wrote a Python script to print `"HelloWorld!"` to verify environment setup.

## Day 2: Python Basics

- Practiced Python syntax and basic functions.

- Topics:
  - User input/output.
  - Arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication).
  - Geometry calculations (area of circle, perimeter/area of rectangle and square).
  - List operations (sorting, finding max/min).
  - Separating even and odd numbers in a list.

- Practice:
  - Implemented and tested each function with sample data.
  - Used print statements to display results.

## Day 3: User Info Console App & Todo Web App

- **Python Console App:**
  - Built a menu-driven program to input and store names and ages.
  - Features:
    - Input multiple names/ages.
    - Age input validation.
    - Print all entered names and ages.
    - Exit option.

- **Web App:**
  - Started a simple Todo List app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Features:
    - Add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
    - Responsive, styled interface.

## Day 4: Python Practice & Algorithms

- Practiced advanced Python problems:
  - `plusMinus`: Calculate and print the ratio of positive, negative, and zero values in a list (6 decimal places).
  - `Leap Year`: Check if a year is a leap year.
  - `OrderedDict`: Sum prices of items by name, maintaining their first occurrence order.

- Improved understanding of:
  - List comprehensions.
  - Dictionary operations and `OrderedDict`.
  - Input parsing and formatted output.

## Day 5: Random Number Guessing Game

- Built a Python script for number guessing games:
  - **User guesses:** Computer picks a random number (1â€“100); user guesses with feedback (too high/low).
  - **Computer guesses:** User thinks of a number; computer uses binary search to guess, user provides feedback.

- Practiced:
  - Using the `random` module.
  - Implementing loops and conditionals.
  - Handling user input and feedback.
